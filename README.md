About the Project
This project aims to predict sales figures based on advertising budgets allocated to TV, radio, and newspaper channels. It utilizes machine learning techniques for regression to provide accurate predictions based on historical data.

Built With
Python
Flask (for backend)
HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for frontend)
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data manipulation and visualization)
scikit-learn (for machine learning)
Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
pip (Python package installer)
Redis (if using caching, optional)
Installation
Clone the repo
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git
Install dependencies
sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask server
sh
Copy code
python app.py
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to view the application.
Usage
Enter the advertising budgets for TV, radio, and newspaper into the input fields.
Click the "Predict" button to see the predicted sales figure based on the entered budgets.
Explore the provided visualizations (pairplot, heatmap) to understand the relationship between advertising budgets and sales.
Model Optimization
The machine learning model is optimized through:

Feature Engineering: Relevant features selected for prediction.
Algorithm Choice: Linear regression chosen for simplicity and interpretability.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Parameters optimized using GridSearchCV for best performance.
Frontend Integration
The frontend is integrated with the backend (Flask server) to send prediction requests and display results to users in real-time.

Example Implementation
Use Python to make a prediction request:

python
Copy code
import requests

url = 'http://localhost:5000/predict'
data = {
    'tv_budget': 100000,
    'radio_budget': 20000,
    'newspaper_budget': 40000
}

response = requests.post(url, json=data)
print(response.json())
